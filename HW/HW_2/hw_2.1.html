    works by
    Barrie, The Little White Bird (1902, with chapters 13–18 published in Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens in 1906), and
    the
    West End stage play Peter Pan; or, the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up (1904, which expanded into the 1911 novel Peter and
    Wendy), the character has been featured in a variety of media and merchandise, both adapting and expanding on
    Barrie's
    works. These include several films, television series and many other works.</p>

<p>Barrie commissioned a statue of Peter Pan by the sculptor George Frampton, which was erected overnight in Kensington
    Gardens on 30 April 1912 as a surprise to the children of London.[1] Six other statues have been cast from the
    original
    mould and displayed around the world. In 2002, Peter Pan featured on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the
    Royal
    Mail on the centenary of Barrie's creation of the character.[2]</p>

<h2>Origin</h2>
<hr>
Peter Pan first appeared as a character in Barrie's The Little White Bird (1902), a novel for adults. In chapters 13–18,
titled "Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens", Peter is a seven-day-old baby and has flown from his nursery to Kensington
Gardens in London, where the fairies and birds taught him to fly. He is described as "betwixt-and-between" a boy and a
bird. Barrie returned to the character of Peter Pan, putting him at the centre of his stage play titled Peter Pan, or
The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up, which premiered on 27 December 1904 at the Duke of York's Theatre in London.[3] Following
the success of the 1904 play, Barrie's publishers, Hodder and Stoughton, extracted the Peter Pan chapters of The Little
White Bird and published them in 1906 under the title Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens, with the addition of
illustrations by Arthur Rackham.[4] Barrie later adapted and expanded the 1904 play's storyline as a novel, which was
published in 1911 as Peter and Wendy.

J. M. Barrie may have based the character of Peter Pan on his older brother, David, who died in an ice-skating accident
the day before his 14th birthday. His mother and brother thought of him as forever a boy.[5]

Physical appearance

Barrie never described Peter's appearance in detail, even in his novel, leaving it to the imagination of the reader and
the interpretation of anyone adapting the character. In the play, Peter's outfit is made of autumn leaves and
cobwebs.[6] His name and playing the flute or pipes suggest the Greek god and mythological character Pan. Barrie
mentions in Peter and Wendy that Peter Pan still had all his "first teeth".[7] He describes him as a "lovely boy, clad
in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees".[7] In The Little White Bird (1902) and Peter Pan in
Kensington Gardens (1906), he is seven days old.[8]

Traditionally, the character has been played on stage by a petite adult woman.[9] In the original productions in the UK,
Peter Pan's costume was a reddish tunic and dark green tights, such as that worn by Nina Boucicault in 1904. This
costume is exhibited at Barrie's Birthplace.[10] The similar costume worn by Pauline Chase (who played the role from
1906 to 1913) is displayed in the Museum of London. Early editions of adaptations of the story also depict a red
costume[11][12] but a green costume (whether or not made of leaves) becomes more usual from the 1920s,[13] and more so
later after the release of Disney's animated movie.

In the Disney films, Peter wears an outfit that consists of a short-sleeved green tunic and tights apparently made of
cloth, and a cap with a red feather in it. He has pointed elf-like ears, brown eyes, and reddish hair.

In Hook (1991), the character is played as an adult by Robin Williams, with blue eyes and dark brown hair; in flashbacks
to him in his youth, his hair is light brown. His ears appear pointed only when he is Peter Pan, not as Peter Banning.
His Pan attire resembles the Disney outfit (minus the cap).

In the live-action 2003 Peter Pan film, he is portrayed by Jeremy Sumpter, with blond hair, green eyes, bare feet and a
costume made of leaves and vines.

In the prequel to the main story 2015 Pan film, he is portrayed by Levi Miller, a young boy who was left as a baby by
the orphanage until he gets captured by Blackbeard's pirates and taken to Neverland. Here he wears just simple clothes.

Personality
Peter is an exaggerated stereotype of a boastful and careless boy. He claims greatness, even when such claims are
questionable (such as congratulating himself when Wendy re-attaches his shadow). In the play and book, Peter symbolises
the selfishness of childhood, and is portrayed as being forgetful and self-centred.

Peter has a nonchalant, devil-may-care attitude, and is fearlessly cocky when it comes to putting himself in danger.
Barrie writes that when Peter thought he was going to die on Marooners' Rock, he felt scared, yet he felt only one
shudder. With this blithe attitude, he says, "To die will be an awfully big adventure." In the play, the unseen and
unnamed narrator ponders what might have been if Peter had stayed with Wendy, so that his cry might have become, "To
live would be an awfully big adventure!", "but he can never quite get the hang of it".[14]
